# Experiments

## Games
- **game**s 1 through 4 are all single player generalization games.

- **mp-game**s are multiplayer, server based generalization games that use Socket.io.

- **videogame** uses Phaser to implement a more dynamic game. 

## Helper Files
- Node.js runs the **app.js** file when the server is being used
- **package.json** outlines dependencies
- **store.js** ports over lodash, works with Mongo, and outlines basic functions such as error throwing.
- **_shared** holds files that are used by all the games. 
- **sharedUtils** holds files related to the server/client that are used by multiplayer games
