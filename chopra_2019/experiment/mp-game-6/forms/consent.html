              In this experiment, you will play
              a fun communication game with another Prolific
              worker. Before starting the game, you will be given further
              instructions and must pass a short quiz testing your
              understanding of the instructions. Please note that you may
              only do this experiment <b>once</b> so do not accept multiple versions of it!
          </p>

          <p>
              We expect the average game to last approximately 15
              minutes, including the time it takes to read instructions and
              wait for another player.
          </p>

          <p>
              The actual duration of the game depends on the cooperation
              of both players. We strongly encourage you to only accept this task if
              you can start immediately, out of fairness to your
              partner.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you find the game is running on the longer side, no need
            to rush or drop out -- leave a comment at the end and/or send
            us an email (vboyce@stanford.edu) and we will make sure
            you're compensated for your time! Please pay attention and do
            your best! Thank you! </p>
