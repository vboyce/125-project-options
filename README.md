## Critcher 2012
*Paper*: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550612457688

*Abstract*: It has been suggested that people attend to others’ actions in the service of forming impressions of their underlying dispositions. If so, it follows that in considering others’ morally relevant actions, social perceivers should be responsive to accompanying cues that help illuminate actors’ underlying moral character. This article examines one relevant cue that can characterize any decision process: the speed with which the decision is made. Two experiments show that actors who make an immoral decision quickly (vs. slowly) are evaluated more negatively. In contrast, actors who arrive at a moral decision quickly (vs. slowly) receive particularly positive moral character evaluations. Quick decisions carry this signal value because they are assumed to reflect certainty in the decision (Experiments 1 and 2), which in turn signals that more unambiguous motives drove the behavior (Experiment 2), which in turn explains the more polarized moral character evaluations. Implications for moral psychology and the law are discussed.

## Atir 2015
*Paper*: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797615588195

*Abstract*: People overestimate their knowledge, at times claiming knowledge of concepts, events, and people that do not exist and cannot be known, a phenomenon called overclaiming. What underlies assertions of such impossible knowledge? We found that people overclaim to the extent that they perceive their personal expertise favorably. Studies 1a and 1b showed that self-perceived financial knowledge positively predicts claiming knowledge of nonexistent financial concepts, independent of actual knowledge. Study 2 demonstrated that self-perceived knowledge within specific domains (e.g., biology) is associated specifically with overclaiming within those domains. In Study 3, warning participants that some of the concepts they saw were fictitious did not reduce the relationship between self-perceived knowledge and overclaiming, which suggests that this relationship is not driven by impression management. In Study 4, boosting self-perceived expertise in geography prompted assertions of familiarity with nonexistent places, which supports a causal role for self-perceived expertise in claiming impossible knowledge.

## Sheppes 2011
*Paper*: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611418350

*Abstract*: Despite centuries of speculation about how to manage negative emotions, little is actually known about which emotion-regulation strategies people choose to use when confronted with negative situations of varying intensity. On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.

## Jordan 2017
*Paper*: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797616685771

*Abstract*: Why do people judge hypocrites, who condemn immoral behaviors that they in fact engage in, so negatively? We propose that hypocrites are disliked because their condemnation sends a false signal about their personal conduct, deceptively suggesting that they behave morally. We show that verbal condemnation signals moral goodness (Study 1) and does so even more convincingly than directly stating that one behaves morally (Study 2). We then demonstrate that people judge hypocrites negatively—even more negatively than people who directly make false statements about their morality (Study 3). Finally, we show that “honest” hypocrites—who avoid false signaling by admitting to committing the condemned transgression—are not perceived negatively even though their actions contradict their stated values (Study 4). Critically, the same is not true of hypocrites who engage in false signaling but admit to unrelated transgressions (Study 5). Together, our results support a false-signaling theory of hypocrisy.

## Vasilyeva 2018
*Paper*: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/cogs.12605

*Abstract*: We report three experiments investigating whether people’s judgments about causal relationships are sensitive to the robustness or stability of such relationships across a range of background circumstances. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that people are more willing to endorse causal and explanatory claims based on stable (as opposed to unstable) relationships, even when the overall causal strength of the relationship is held constant. In Experiment 2, we show that this effect is not driven by a causal generalization’s actual scope of application. In Experiment 3, we offer evidence that stable causal relationships may be seen as better guides to action. Collectively, these experiments document a previously underappreciated factor that shapes people’s causal reasoning: the stability of the causal relationship.

## Sloman 2016
*Paper:* https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797616662271

*Abstract:* In four experiments, we tested the community-of-knowledge hypothesis, that people fail to distinguish their own knowledge from other people’s knowledge. In all the experiments, despite the absence of any actual explanatory information, people rated their own understanding of novel natural phenomena as higher when they were told that scientists understood the phenomena than when they were told that scientists did not yet understand them. In Experiment 2, we found that this occurs only when people have ostensible access to the scientists’ explanations; the effect does not occur when the explanations exist but are held in secret. In Experiment 3, we further ruled out two classes of alternative explanations (one appealing to task demands and the other proposing that judgments were mediated by inferences about a phenomenon’s understandability). In Experiment 4, we ruled out the possibility that the effect could be attributed to a pragmatic inference.

## Long 2017
*Paper:* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717301932

*Abstract:* When we view a picture of an object, we automatically recognize what the object is and know how big it typically is in the world (Konkle & Oliva, 2012). Is information about an object’s size activated only after we’ve identified the object, or can this size information be activated before object recognition even occurs? We previously found that big and small objects differ in mid-level perceptual features (Long, Konkle, Cohen, & Alvarez, 2016). Here we asked whether these perceptual features can automatically trigger real-world size processing, bypassing the need for basic-level object recognition. To test this hypothesis, we used an image synthesis algorithm to generate “texform” images, which are unrecognizable versions of big and small objects that still preserve some textural and form information from the original images. Across two experiments, we find that even though these synthesized stimuli cannot be identified, they automatically trigger familiar size processing and give rise to a Size-Stroop effect. Furthermore, we isolate perceived curvature as one feature the visual system uses to infer real-world size. These results suggest that mid-level perceptual features can automatically feed forward to facilitate object processing, and challenge the idea that we must first identify an object before we can access its higher-level properties.

Abstract: Human knowledge accumulates over generations, amplifying our individual learning abilities. What is the mechanism of this accumulation? Here, we explore how language allows accurate transmission of conceptual knowledge. We introduce a novel experimental paradigm that allows direct comparison of learning from examples and learning from language. In our experiment, a teacher first learns a Boolean concept from examples; they then communicate this concept to a student in a free conversation; finally, we test both teacher and student on the same transfer items. We find that learning from language is both sufficient and efficient: Students achieve accuracy very close to their teachers, while studying for less time. We then explore the language used by teachers and find heavy reliance on generics and quantifiers. Taken together, these results suggest that cultural accumulation of conceptual knowledge arises from the ability of language to directly convey generalizations.
